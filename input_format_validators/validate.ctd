# This is a sample input validator, written for the checktestdata validation
# language (see:

# Please refer to the comments in README.md for a description of the syntax it
# is validating. Then, change it as you need.

# First line: M N
# M: non-negative, can be very large (Imma keep it up to  10^30 here, as specified in our question)
# N: number of problems, at least 1 (upper bound chosen generously)

# Second line: topic preferences (one line, may have one or more tokens).
# We just enforce “no embedded newlines”; Python validator will do strict checks.
REGEX("[^\n]*") NEWLINE

# Next N lines: each problem
# Format:
#   Problem_No  Points  Difficulty  Topic  Text_Length
#
# Problem_No   : positive integer (allow up to 10^9 here)
# Points       : non-negative integer (up to 10^30, Python will also enforce ≤ M)
# Difficulty   : integer from 1 to 10
# Topic        : non-empty, no whitespace
# Text_Length  : integer, 1..10000
