Problem Title: Procrastination Optimization
Topic: Heaps

Description:
This problem is about choosing a set of Kattis problems that gets you at least M points while trying to minimize effort in a specific priority order. Every problem comes with a point value, a difficulty rating, a topic, and a text length. The goal is to reach full marks but pick problems that are as easy and short as possible, and ideally from topics you’re more comfortable with.

The priorities, in order, are:
1. Minimize total difficulty.
2. Minimize the number of problems chosen.
3. Prefer higher-ranked topics (based on the topic list given in the input).
4. Minimize total text length.

Input:
- Line 1: M and N.
- Line 2: A list of distinct topics, ordered from “best understood” to “worst understood.”
- Next N lines: Each problem in the format  
  `Problem_No Points Difficulty Topic Text_Length`.

Output:
Print the problem numbers you choose (in increasing order), or -1 if it’s impossible to reach M points.

Why Heaps:
We chose heaps because the search space can grow pretty quickly, and we need a way to always consider the “most promising” combinations first. Using priority queues lets us sort potential subsets by our lexicographic criteria and prune weaker options early. This keeps the solution fast enough even when M is very large or when the scoring trade-offs get complicated.

Test Generation:
- Sample1/2/3 match the examples shown in our PDF.
- Secret tests are randomly generated with N ≤ 25 and M up to 10^15.
- All test cases follow the final input format (M N, topic list, then N problem lines).
- Each `.ans` file is produced using our accepted solution.

Validator:
The validator checks that the input structure is valid and that all fields are well-formed. Points don’t need to be ≤ M (this matches both the PDF and our samples).

Solution:
Our accepted solution uses a combination of heaps and pruning to efficiently explore valid subsets and compare them based on the four priority rules.
